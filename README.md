## Rules for technologies record

## Rules for boilerplate record

1. Each boilerplate record must contain only technologies records from the `technologies.csv` file.
2. Combination of `name` and `version` fields must be unique.
3. If there are two records with the same `name`, they must have different and non-empty `version` field values.
